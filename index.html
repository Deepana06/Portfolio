            <h2>Academic Projects</h2>
            <h2>FITHUB Management System </h2>
			<h2>Programming Language:</h2>
			<li>MySQL, NoSQL, Python</li>
			<h2>Description:</h2>
			<li>Designed ER diagrams, schema, Relational model and Designed Database related to all the entities of Fithub data management system</li>
			<li>Developed store procedures, functions, Triggers, views to monitor the User details and daily activities within the system</li>
			<li>Utilized Python script to develop EDA visualizations to analyse various trends </li>
			<h2>Crime dataset Analysis </h2>
			<h2>Programming Language:</h2>
			<li>Python</li>
			<h2>Description:</h2>
			<li>Utilized time series forecasting methods like ARIMA to examine customer behaviour and forecast future trends.
			This involved thorough data cleaning and conducting several exploratory data analysis (EDA) tasks to gain insights 
			into the dataset's characteristics and patterns</li>
			<h2>Customer segmentation</h2>
			<h2>Programming Language:</h2>
			<li>Python</li>
			<h2>Description:</h2>
			<li>Focused on customer segmentation using Python. This involves applying several analytical techniques to better understand customer behaviour and preferences. 
			Two key methods used were RFM analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) and the K-means clustering technique.
			RFM analysis is a method commonly used in marketing and retail to segment customers based on three main criteria:
			Recency: How recently a customer made a purchase or interacted with the business.
			Frequency: How often a customer makes purchases or engages with the business over a specific period.
			Monetary: How much money a customer spends on purchases or transactions within a given timeframe.
			By analysing these factors, RFM analysis helps categorize customers into different segments such as high-value customers, loyal customers, potential churners, etc. 
			In addition to RFM analysis, employed the K-means clustering technique. In the context of customer segmentation, 
			K-means clustering helps identify groups of customers with similar characteristics or purchasing behaviours.</li>
			<h2>EEG Classification</h2>
			<h2>Programming Language/Technology:</h2>
			<li>Python, Machine Learning</li>
			<h2>Description:</h2>
			<li>Utilizing a range of machine learning methods such as Logistic Regression, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), 
			and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), conducted a comprehensive analysis of patients with seizures and those without seizures. 
			This involved training and evaluating models to accurately classify EEG data, distinguishing between seizure and non-seizure patterns.
			The performance of these models was rigorously assessed using standard metrics including accuracy, precision, and F1 score.</li>
			<h2>S&P 500 Stock Analysis</h2>
			<h2>Programming Language/Technology:</h2>
			<li>Python, Machine Learning</li>
			<h2>Description:</h2>
			<li>Performed an in-depth analysis of the S&P 500 stock values, 
			gathering historical data from associated firms within the S&P index.
			To assess the influence of these variables on the S&P 500 stock price and predict future trends, 
			I employed various Machine Learning Models. These included Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree algorithms. 
			By leveraging these models, I aimed to understand the intricate relationships between the performance of constituent stocks 
			and the overall S&P 500 index, enhancing forecasting capabilities and strategic decision-making in stock market investments.</li>
			<h2>Mental Health Impact Analysis</h2>
